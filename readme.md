### Installation

upload and active the clearfix plugin.

### Usage

This plugin doesn't have any options. It simply adds a shortcode to WordPress.

To use, type the shortcode `[clearfix]` into your WordPress post. When displayed,
the shortcode will be replaced with a `div` element that has a `clear:both;`
CSS style property.

You can also use `[clearfix left]` and `[clearfix right]` to use `clear:left;`
and `clear:right` respectively.
